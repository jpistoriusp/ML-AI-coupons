# ML-AI-coupons

This is my first capstone project for my ML/AI course from Berkeley .
This project showcases my skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn and utalizing them to clean and present data.

This dataset is from Kaggle: 

This determines which customers will accept a coupon while driving if they are in a certain radius of a shop.

I drew the following from my observations: 
For bar coupons, a customer is twice if not more likely to accept the coupon if any of the following fit their criteria:

- The customer visits bars 4 or more times a month
- The customer is over the age of 25 and frequents bars
- The customer has no kids in the car, and frequents bars (Here the customer is almost 4 times as likely to accept the coupon)
- The customer frequently visits bars and makes less than 50k a year
- The customer frequently visits bars and is under the age of 30
- The customer frequently visits bars, is not widowed, and has no kids in the car

Most of the points have the following thing in common: The customer will likely accept a bar coupon if they visit bars mroe than 3 times in a given month and is presented with a coupon.
